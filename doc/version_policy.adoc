== Versioning, Release and Support policy

In general XS2A Team follows http://semver.org/[SemVer] for versioning.

This means our versions follow the model *A.B.C*, where:

* *A* - major version, pointing out mainline.
* *B* - minor version, points out next release in the mainline. Minimum 2 versions backward compatibility is guaranteed for _stable_ mainlines.
* *C* - hotfix version, used to deliver patches between releases in case of need. May be omitted, therefore version `4.5` will be equal to `4.5.0`.

We support one stable and one development version at glance.

To keep it simple:

* We use *even* major version to mark *stable* support mainlines (`2.x`, `4.x`, `6.x` etc)
* We use *odd* major version to mark *development* mainlines (`1.x`, `3.x`, `5.x` etc)

Normally new development version is released every two weeks, however this is not a strict rule, rather our willingness.

https://adorsys.de/kontakt/[adorsys Team] guarantees general support of this XS2A library at least till 01.03.2022.

=== Backward compatibility

For stable mainlines we provide backward compatiblity of APIs and Database schema.
Although for stable versions backward compatibility is high priority and we try our best to keep it as much as possible,
we can guarantee backward compatibility only for two versions before.

I.e. if you get version `4.25`, it will keep backward compatibility with `4.24` and `4.23`,
but some changes may appear between APIs of version `4.25` with version `4.22`.

The same is valid for the database schema.

If you need extended support, please contact https://adorsys.de/kontakt/[adorsys Team].

=== Stable versions

Stable versions are recommended for production usage. Normally they have support period of time at least 6 months plus 3 more versions after development version is released as new Stable version.
Here is an example of releases at timeline:
